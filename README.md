# About Atlas

The Woman, Life, Freedom Movement has been characterized by a fervent desire for unity among the Iranian diaspora. While this cohesion is essential to amplify the voices of Iranian activists, the movement currently comprises numerous, independent and siloed initiatives.

The Atlas project aims to bridge these gaps and create a unified front by:

**Understanding the Movement’s Evolution**:  
Tracing the historical development of the movement to identify key milestones and challenges.

**Mapping the Network**:  
Analyzing the existing network structures within the movement to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for collaboration.

**Deepening Understanding**:  
Conducting in-depth studies to gain a nuanced understanding of the movement’s dynamics and needs.

**Assessing Resources**:  
Evaluating both qualitative and quantitative resources available to the movement to inform strategic planning.

**Measuring Impact**:  
Tracking progress and setbacks to refine strategies and measure the effectiveness of collaborative efforts.

**Informing the Future**:  
Designing and conducting surveys to gather feedback from movement participants and inform future initiatives.

By systematically addressing these areas, the Atlas project seeks to foster a collaborative environment essential for the advancement of the Woman, Life, Freedom Movement.
