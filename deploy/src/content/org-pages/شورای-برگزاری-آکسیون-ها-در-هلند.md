about: "The 'Women, Life, Freedom' Belgium Network is most likely a group or coalition of individuals and organizations in Belgium who are actively supporting the ongoing movement for women's rights, freedom, and equality in Iran. This movement, sparked by the tragic death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022, has resonated globally, and it appears that activists in Belgium have mobilized to show solidarity and contribute to the cause"
